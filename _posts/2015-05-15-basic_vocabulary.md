Alright then !. Lets get started.

## Some words before we start.

I am not just looking to create a new language but as it goes for any language, I have to build a culture too. So, the people who speak __crang__ have a different culture of their own. This will be reflected in their vocabulary. Keep in mind that the community is primarily a fishing community.

P.S : There will be a post about the people of crang, but for now lets begin with some words.
