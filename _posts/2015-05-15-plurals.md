## The plural morpheme.

The plural morpheme is one of the few morphemes which are prefixing. 
The morpheme is *'t'*

## Some words and their plurals

| Sno | Word  | Plural | Meaning |
|:----|:-----:|:------:|--------:|
| 1  | iE     | tiE    | boats   |
|--------
| 2  | EA     | tEA    | fishes  |
|--------
| 3  | ark    | tark   | nets    |
|--------
| 4  | Oz     | tOz    | circles, whirlpools   | 
|=======

The above are examples where a vowel follows the plural morpheme. But there are cases where the following sound is not a vowel but a consonant in such case, the plural morpheme has an allomorph, *'ta'* the 'a' sound is addedfor phonological convinence.

### Cases with consonants

| Sno | Word  | Plural | Meaning |
|:----|:-----:|:------:|--------:|
| 1   | ti     | tati  | men   |
|--------
| 2   | tin    | tatin | women |
|--------
| 3   | gAz    | tagAz | waves |
|--------
| 4   | sAr    | tasAr | spears | 
|--------
| 5   | dAgu   | tadAgu | birds  | 
|--------
| 6   | rIs    | tarIs  | flower buds | 
|--------
| 7   | kai    | takai | clear water fishes | 
|--------
| 8   | mut    | tamut | winds | 
|--------
| 9   | fU    | tafU   | airs | 
|--------
| 10  | kre   | takre | mouths | 
|=======

With words starting with 'l' the plural changes its form, it is *'k'*.

### 't' to 'k' change

The 'k' change is **not** an allomorph. It is a phonological change of 't' to 'k' where ever 'l' follows not just in plurals.
