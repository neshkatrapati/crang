I call them adjectivals because they are not strictly adjectives. They are nouns.That is they are morphologically and to an extent, syntactically nouns. They show no special morphological behavior vis-a-vis nouns and they can be used as stand-alone nouns.

To explain this, take an example. "small" in english is an adjective, but the equivalent in crang you can find is "smallness". Similarly you will find "cheapness" and "speediness". 

So, remember that adjectivals are **not** a separate syntactic category. 

## Some adjectivals with their meaning.

| Sno | Word | Meaning |
|:----|:----:|-------:|
| 1   | hOn   | speed/speediness  |
|--------
| 2   | tOn   | slowness |
|--------
| 3   | rir   | cheapness |
|--------
| 4   | kIm   | smallness |
|--------
| 5   | pIm   | bigness |
|--------
| 6   | nul   | line, straightness, propreity  |

## Morphology of the Adjectivals

So how does an adjectival combine with the noun ?. Infixing !
Infixing in crang is anything but straightforward. But, for now assume that the infix occurs after the first vowel of the word under consideration.

### Some Examples


| Sno | Word  | Adjectival | Final Form  | Meaning     |
|:----|:-----:|:----------:|:------------|------------:|
| 1   | iE    | hOn	   | i-hOn-E     | fast boat   |
|--------
| 2   | iE    | tOn	   | i-tOn-E     | slow boat   |

The point where the word *splits* is at this moment not very clear and not very important. Look out for an article on infixing rules later on this blog. 

Although I have listed some of the adjectivals here, Many of the nouns also can act as adjectivals. For example, Let us observe some of the nouns which have been dealt with [here](http://neshkatrapati.github.io/crang/basic_vocabulary/)

| Sno | Word  | Adjectival | Final Form  | Meaning     |
|:----|:-----:|:----------:|:------------|------------:|
| 1   | rIs   | Oz	   | r-Oz-Is     | round flower bud   |
|--------
| 2   | kre   | Oz	   | k-Oz-re     | round mouth/ somebody who gossips |
|--------
| 3   | ti    | Oz	   | t-Oz-i      | round man/fat man  |
|--------
| 4   | nul   | Oz	   | n-Oz-ul     | round line/something nonexistent  |
|--------
