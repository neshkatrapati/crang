Let us start with the basic numerals in crang. The numbers are counted in base 10. This post also covers ordinal numbers as well.

As it is with any linguistic device in crang, numbers become particles. These are then infixed to become modifiers.

| Number | Cardinal | Ordinal  |
|:-------|:---------|:--------:|
| 1	 | az       | al       | 
|-----------
| 2      | biz      | bil      | 
|--------
| 3      | vez      | vel      |
|--------
| 4      | noz      | nol      |
|--------
| 5      | miz      | mil      | 
|--------
| 6      | yoz      | yol      |
|--------
| 7      | cez      | cel      |
|--------
| 8      | khiz     | khil     |
|--------
| 9      | sez      | sol      |
|--------
| 10     | toz      | tol      |
|=======
{: rules="groups"}


Now, to quantify nouns, these will be infixed in the following way.


| Number | Cardinal | Word  | Meaning    | Final Form  | Translation |
|:-------|:---------|:-----:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1	 | az       | iE    | boat       | i-az-E      | one boat    |
|-----------
| 2      | biz      | ti    | man        | t(a)-bi-[i] | two men     | 
|--------
| 3      | vez      | den   | hand       | de-ve-n     | three hands |
|--------
| 4      | noz      | nul   | line	 | nu-no-l     | four lines  |
|---------
| 5      | miz      | van   | brain/mind | va-mi-n     | five minds/half mind |
|--------
| 6      | yoz      | riz   | flower bud | ri-yo-z     | six buds    |
|--------
| 7      | cez      | sAT   | thread     | sA-ce-T     | seven threads |
|--------
| 8      | khiz     | bir   | tree       | bi-khi-r    | eight trees |
|--------
| 9      | sez      | EA    | fish       | E-se-A      | nine fishes |
|--------
| 10     | toz      | boyn  | land       | bo-to-yn    | ten lands   |
|=======

Behaviour to notice : 

  - Although every ordinal ends with `z`, it does not figure in the infixing process except for `az`
  - Noun does not agree with the quantifier and vice-versa like english does.


PS : (x) indicates that x is added and [x] indicates that x is removed
