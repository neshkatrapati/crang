## What is Crang ?
Crang is a conlang created by me which explores many awkward linguistic phenomena. Primarily it looks at infixing. 

## Why ?
For fun of course.

## Features of Crang.
* Primarily infixing
* Morphologically near-agglutinative (Whatever Agglutination means in the terms of infixing)
* Syntactically, a case based, free word order language although, it has SOV as it main order.
* Devoid of any pronouns.
* And many more.
# Etymology

Okay, I call the language crang but, it is a short form of 'krEvAngu'

{% highlight yaml %}
krE  + Angu => kreEvAngu 
mouth  work => Mouth-Work => Speech/Language
{% endhighlight %}

The 'v' in the middle is the result of fusion/(c.f liason, sandhi) at the morphophonemic border.

# Script
I am also developing two scripts, one abiguida and another which is not.
