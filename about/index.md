This is my first shot at creating a conlang. I have been always fascinated with creating an artificial language for some time. But then, I had no training in linguistics to make that happen in an ordered fashion. As of now, I am into MS CompLing so, I know the A-B-C-Ds of lingusitics. That and the inspiration from Dothraki and High Valyrian by David J. Peterson helped me to start this off.
